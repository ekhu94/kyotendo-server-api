Not bad additions, just the bare minimum. Here's what id do to fix it. \n\nTWEAKS:\n\nTo start off, keep enemies regenerating health but have it regenerate at half the speed it usually does. This alone would make them feel way less spongy, while still keeping the urgency.\n\nSecondly, double the damage of both Link and the enemies. It'd be a nice give and take. Makes you feel stronger while also forcing you to be more weary of enemy attacks. \n\nSince im doubling the damage output of link and the enemies, weapons should break faster too, not so much where they break in two hits. But they should break 3-4 hits earlier than they usually would. Ik on paper this sounds terribly unfun but i think this would force the player to use items they usually wouldnt late game, like wooden spoons and stuff of that nature.\n\nTweak how bloodmoons work, instead of having the bloodmoon being a simple event/cutscene now they last an entire night. During a bloodmoon enemies do even more damage and regenerate health twice as fast but also drop twice the loot. This includes weapons. \n\nNEW ADDITIONS:\n\nFirst off, they should've flipped the map. Flipping the map aswell as adding the new floating platforms wouldve made the map feel super fresh. Bonus points if they flipped the inside of all the shrines too.\n\nSecond, Add Guardian scouts to the Overworld. Mastermode is supposed to be genuinely hard right? How about instead of having bullet sponge enemies you just throw in enemies the player isnt used to seeing in the Overworld. I think every medium-large enemy camp should have atleast 1 or 2 guardian scouts.\n\nAdd a hunger bar. Works sorta like minecraft. You no longer heal by eating food. You heal naturally over time by having a full hunger bar. If your hunger bar gets too low you run and climb a tad bit slower. If your hunger bar is depleted you slowly *SLOWLY* lose health and run and climb even slower.",

On top of that, the town was abandoned and everything looked destroyed, I quickly realized that because of Link being gone, that Ganondorf must’ve took over Hyrule and that was even more disturbing to me, as it reminded me of Hitler and the Holocaust. \n\n\n\n\n\nI see the Redeads but at the time I didn’t know their name. They looked so scary and I genuinely got that scary feeling in my stomach as soon as I saw them. I made the dumb mistake of walking in front of one of them and oooof...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only does the Redead screech really ugly (my volume was high) but it proceeds to hump Link and suck the blood out of Link’s body? I tried doing everything but literally nothing was happening. I was so freaked out that I turned off the console and gave no craps whats so ever for save data, I just wanted to get out of there. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI remember not being able to sleep that night, and being happy to go to school because I could forget about what happened and be surrounded by my friends. It wouldn’t be a good month or 2 until I went back to OOT and realized all you have to do is just avoid them and it’ll be good, sure they are scary and the screams will still happen, but at least I won’t see Link be helpless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Redeads in general are messed up creatures when you think about it. I can’t help think if they’re doing rape or not because they do hump on anyone with not letting that person escape. Again, I always feel bad for Link but now in days, I just get upset since that means I’m going to die without a doubt or I’m gonna have to reset my game.",

My first thought went immediately to Zelda - A link to the past, the SNES version to be clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time my uncle had given me his console along with Zelda and Super Mario. The latter, however, I played it later, I could not resist the charm of the young Hylia catapulted into an adventure bigger than him, to the rescue of a princess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must point out one thing, however. The game was in English and I, being Italian, I did not understand anything of the dialogue. I had to imagine the plot using the many clues that the game gave me. A fundamental tool was the map, with the various missions marked on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWrapped by the feels I decided to replay it but, not having the console, I had to opt for a PC emulator. I was not more in the skin, finally I would restart the game being able to understand the various dialogues and the various writings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beginning of the game is very fast and immersive. The kingdom is in danger and our task is to save it from a powerful Wizard. Nothing complicated except for the fact that he has barricaded himself behind a magical barrier. To reach the Wizard Ganon we must gather the three medallions necessary to reach the legendary Master Sword, required to break the barrier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this stage of the game you are free to explore Hyrule, a land full of details and secrets, in search of the various dungeons. Thinking about it, I remember the hours spent facing labyrinths and the most difficult trials, the excitement of finding the Boss Key, the map, but especially the thrill of discovering what object was hidden in the great chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the scariest part came at the end, when I found myself facing the boss on duty, urged on by the musical theme of the boss fight. I found it curious how to replay it I remembered perfectly some music and sound effects, such as the sound of enemies when they were hit or the sound of secrets when they were unlocked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf the first three bosses I will mention the one that has always put me more anxiety: the first. Numerous animated statues dancing around the room, the pace increasingly frantic and fast. To replay it I felt almost the same anxiety that I felt as a child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce the medallions are collected, Link can finally pull out the Master Word. The part of the game in the forest of illusions is really nice, with a pleasant and cheerful music. When we finally manage to draw the sword we have to do nothing but head to the castle and face the wizard Ganon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember that when I played it for the first time, I thought the game would end with the death of the magician. Instead, surprisingly, the wizard manages to kidnap Zelda and catapult Link into the world of shadows. This realm is ruled by our enemy, hidden inside his castle and protected by a magical barrier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo break the palace's defenses you must collect nine crystals with 9 princesses imprisoned in them. These crystals are obviously protected by as many bosses nestled in their dungeons.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really enjoyed the dark and scary atmosphere that the game manages to convey in its second part. Everything is transformed, nothing is as it seems. Normal humans can not keep their original form and often end up lost, transformed into monstrous beings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRe-reading it, I finally understood many of the things that were not clear to me and corrected some ideas I had as a child. Maybe I broke the spell a bit 'but I must say that I really enjoyed being able to finally connect the various pieces, discovering a vast lore and rich elements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVery nice some secondary quests. To give an example I cite the trunk that follows you throughout the map and the only way to open it is to find the king of thieves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf the bosses of the shadow world I can not fail to mention the evil moth, hidden in the maze of the cursed forest. As for the dungeons I can mention the complicated water dungeon, where you can find the mythical grappling hook. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce reunited the princesses you are ready for the final boss fight. Fairly easy and similar to the first confrontation with Ganon. Unexpectedly the true form of our enemy is revealed, hiding in the large pyramid in the center of the map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe final fight is quite difficult. As a child it took me forever because I could not get the silver arrows needed to hurt Ganondorf and in the end I could not believe that I finally beat him by force of trials. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must say that replaying ''A link to the past'' was like taking a dip in the past, many things I remembered while many others I had just removed. Each dungeon has managed to give me some trouble and with some bosses I died more than once. My opinion is more than positive and not surprisingly this is a game that has made history. \n\nHave you ever played this title? What are the elements you remember most?",

And then Link travels around and does legend of zelda shit and he finds a way to instead of seal Demise but just trade off the triforce of courage with the TFoP and both destroy the triforce and Demise for good. \n\nIt could have the Goddesses granting a final battle wish of strength to destroy the artifact and when the game ends he can sit down In a chair and when it fades to black he can finally speak and say\n\n\"Thank you... for everything\". \n\nWhat would be your final Game idea?",

        "selftext": "I’m writing this after just completing Breath of the Wild for the first time while my initial impressions remain fresh. I am only slightly drunk, and have no expectations for anybody else to actually read this- just sharing my thoughts aloud to this campfire of a community. What I am about to write is in no way discrediting the love that so many people have for this game. Every person has their own opinions, and I think that’s wonderful. I can see why so many folks adore this game so heavily, and I also think that Breath of the Wild is an objectively great game- but for me, it was not a great Zelda game.\n\nI’m 22, and after getting laid off from a video producing gig (perhaps my first real “adult job”) that I held for over a year, I finally caved and bought a Switch with tax returns as well as this game to bide unemployment time. I grew up with Zelda, I was born within weeks of the release of Ocarina of Time, and I credit playing that game in grade school as being the single experience that saw me change seeing video games as a childhood hobby to seeing them as an incredible artistic niche that so many sadly never get to experience. This series was my favorite growing up, and up to Skyward Sword (which released when I was in sixth grade), I had played and owned all of them spare the spin-offs. A Link to the Past challenged me, Link’s Awakening and Majora’s Mask redefined the concept of a sequel for me, and growing up as the Wind Waker and Twilight Princess released, this series did nothing but continue to absolutely amaze me. Even the less exciting entries in comparison to their larger siblings, like the DS or Capcom titles, offered new dungeons, new boss fights, and new characters to make forever lasting friendships with. It broke my heart to enter adulthood just as Breath of the Wild was set to be released, and for me to be paying bills unable to get the latest console the series was to release on. It took years to finally experience the legendary game so many had raved as perhaps the greatest of all time... and I find my heart breaking once again having now completed it.\n\nMy criticisms to follow in no way diminish the extraordinary talent and efforts of the development team. A world so grandiose is not made in a day, and pricing so much content at only $60 remains a bargain if ever there was one. However, this leads into what is perhaps my greatest criticism, which is that the game feels like little more than that: content, for the sake of being content. Something I’ve realized that past titles benefited from in being so tight knit in terms of material is that their worlds feel more original and rich as a result. More care is put into less and simple things, like Windfall Island, Clockwork Town, or Ocarina’s Kakariko come alive with just enough to pay attention to. Breath of the Wild has so much *stuff* in general that it’s hard to know what to look at a lot of the time. I never stuck around in any particular town because I was already onto the next one. The game is essentially split into two parts, the overworld half, and the shrine/dungeon half. The overworld half, as incredible in size and detail as it may be, felt little more to me than a Zelda skinned Assassin’s Creed title, a series I could never get into for a similar reason. Breath of the World introduces you to the largest toy box imaginable within a couple hours of playtime, and the freedom is exhilarating, something other titles maybe could have benefited from. However, the opening reveals the biggest cracks right away. You look at some of the worse paced openings in 3D Zelda games, such as Twilight Princess or Skyward Sword, that soak a little much in the world without any excitement. However, something both of these titles do is emphasize the importance of bonds and character in their respective worlds. The children in Ordon Village as well as the more lively iteration of Zelda alongside the fashionable Groose gang make for such interesting worlds that we become impatiently eager to see the rest. Majora’s Mask contrasts this, instead opting for a hopeless and empty world that both Link and his new fairy companion each find themselves in, which makes their forced friendship something honestly capable of growth and understanding. But Link in Breath of the Wild has no companion, which is fine on it’s own but he additionally has no existing friends aside from people he has no memory of (which you can slightly expand upon in *optional* content territory), and no friendships to really form aside from descendants that feel essential to the plot of saving Hyrule but not to Link’s story. Link’s story isn’t just lonely like in Majora’s Mask, as here it feels hollow. What would be in comparison the average amount of time to spend with an area themed character is now cut in half, with the 100-year bygone champions and their spunky relatives. We spend so little time with any of them that they feel unmemorable, and altogether somewhat useless, as a kid with amnesia wakes up and manages to do what these guys have been training their entire lives for with ease. The dungeon half of the game also felt like a bit of a let down. The concept of shrines was interesting, but continues the rabbit hole of content, for the sake of being content. Previous entries had almost no such comparable optional areas, and while this kind of thing may have enriched their experiences, development detail instead went to their themed dungeons that took us to magma infested caves, haunted ritual sites, and even alternate dimensions. Every shrine in Breath of the Wild is skinned the same, and all of it’s dungeons aside from the castle are just different gimmick feathers of the same bird. Even the castle managed to feel incredible facetious as I simply scaled the walls and waterfalls, fighting a total of zero enemies en route to the game’s climax. The boss fights were fine and even enjoyable at times, but somewhat repetitive as well, playing into the idea of relying on the (impressively well designed) game’s physics controls within the Sheikah slate. I also felt hardly motivated to explore for so much of the title because of the weapon break system- something that had turned me off going in, but I had been willing to give the benefit of the doubt. The truth is, it feels redundant. The idea of having so many weapons is absolutely fascinating and revolutionary for the series, and I can’t help but feel if they had been either rare drops or very limited finds in the world that never broke but instead offered different movesets or perks, I would have felt more incentivized to take on more. However, I typically ignored enemies because all they offered (in addition to breaking my weapons) was drops to make unnecessary upgrades to armor and camp chests offering otherwise easily acquired rupees or more breakable weapons. Content, for the sake of being content. I stopped just short of 20 heart containers (the usual norm) and never upgraded my stamina bar. I feel little motivation now, having seen the credits roll, to revisit this world as I know there is still so much to do. Around seventy shrines, hundreds of entries in the compendium, and God knows how many Korok seeds left for me, a person who 100% completed Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess, I just feel exhausted as it is. Maybe it’s because I’m no longer a kid and am just out of touch, or maybe this particular direction just wasn’t for me. But I suppose I am grateful for the experience and hopeful that the series continues to innovate and rework itself, without caring too much about appeasing aging diehards such as myself. I love the Legend of Zelda, and I always will.",

Content, for the sake of being content. I stopped just short of 20 heart containers (the usual norm) and never upgraded my stamina bar. I feel little motivation now, having seen the credits roll, to revisit this world as I know there is still so much to do. Around seventy shrines, hundreds of entries in the compendium, and God knows how many Korok seeds left for me, a person who 100% completed Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess, I just feel exhausted as it is. Maybe it’s because I’m no longer a kid and am just out of touch, or maybe this particular direction just wasn’t for me. But I suppose I am grateful for the experience and hopeful that the series continues to innovate and rework itself, without caring too much about appeasing aging diehards such as myself. I love the Legend of Zelda, and I always will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

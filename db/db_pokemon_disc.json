Some of my idle musings:\n\n-A Silver Streak/Pelham 123 spoof in the Nimbasa City subway.\n\n-An assortment of period pieces based on the myths involving various legendaries.\n\n-A Tennessee Williams equivalent, because of course there is (â€˜Glameow on a Hot Tin Roofâ€™ anyone?).\n\n-A King Kong-sequel franchise involving giant PokÃ©mon; since weâ€™ve already got Tyranitar as a Godzilla equivalent.\n\n-In Kalos, seeing as itâ€™s based on France, at least one piece involving a good-looking depressed guy/PokÃ©mon looking out the window for thirty minutes.",

The one companion I would like Ash to end up with, and friendships/relationships that I genuinely believe will make a reappearance in the future.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure there are some who will disagree with me, and that&amp;#39;s alright. We all are entitled to our opinions, but this is mine, personally. I hope to see Clemont and Bonnie in the future, and I think if they ever end the anime/manga, Ash will end up with Serena. It just makes sense, especially with all the history they have. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are hesitant to continue the anime after May(I didn&amp;#39;t like her), give XY/Z a chance. Very good, and honestly my favorite, even including Kanto.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

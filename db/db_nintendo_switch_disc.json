        "selftext": "I saw some posts here regarding Littlewood and got excited.  I even watched some reviews on youtube and I said, this is right on my alley. I played Stardew long time back and made it to 6-7 full seasons.  TL/DR below.\n  \n\n**Good things:**\n  \n\n* Stardew is not a relaxing game for me because of the clock.  I am always rushing to do things, because I want to get the best out of everything.  Now Littlewood did it differently with their energy bar.  Which is I really like, because you can explore on your own, and not rush things.\n  \n\n* \"Return to home\" and \"return to town\" quick travel is really good, since the gameplay is not about time management, you don't need to do the mundane stuff of walking back home.\n  \n\n* Building your town, from the houses, to the paths, to the decorations.\n\n\n  \n**Now on to the bad things:**\n  \n* People are bland, the characters are the usual trope. I am not asking them the characters to be written as great novels, but they are so bland that I can't even bother to talk to them, or know their story.  \n  \n* Story will only progress based on relationship levels, so if you don't like one character, too bad, you wont get the upgrades that you need.  So you are forced to grind talking to them.  Their dialogues are repeating repeating repeating.\n  \n* Farming doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter if you farm well, because you will still be limited on how much you can sell.  So you are going to be stuck with a lot of fruits/vegetables that you wont even care.  No variety.\n  \n* Money is only a wall to grind your upgrades, and even if you do well, like I mentioned in farming or cooking, you can only gain so much.  So it doesn't matter.  Your progress doesn't matter.\n  \n* Items are needed to improve one NPC house.  Items are gated by different vendors. I already bought all at the Normal Shop, Decor shop, and they don't even sell anything anymore. Even after you max upgraded the shops to sell ALL items, it will only still sell a few.  Now those shops doesn't sell anything anymore, I am just waiting for the Auction house every Saturday and Sunday.  You are time-gated.\n  \n* Grind.  Grind levels so you can farm this, but it doesn't matter anyway, you wont be able to sell much.  There is no point or even the dangling carrot of gameplay that hey, do this to achieve this.\n  \n* I don't like when I talked to the NPC who has the boat, and said, you can only use my boat if you give 10k wood.  Then the dialog was closed.  I thought it was real and that the gameplay will allow me to harvest such number. But no, you have to talk to him and he will tell you, haha it is just a joke. I mean, why close the dialog and let the player roam free.  I did a full year without knowing I can already use the boat on Season 1.\n  \n* 99 on a relationship, flirt, date, doesn't matter, it wont go up or it wont do anything.  Is this an unfinished game?\n   \n* Now I have money that I can't spend, and almost max on my skills, that I thought will move forward the story.  But no, I still have one area that is locked.  I need to grind to sell some shit on the vendor so I can be visited by someone just to move the story.  I mean, that is really a bad design.\n\n**Verdict:**\n  \nAll in all, I really regret getting this game. I really regret having this game to the point that I have to make this post.\n  \n  \n\n**TL:DR**\n  \nThis is a waste of purchase for me.",

It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you farm well, because you will still be limited on how much you can sell.  So you are going to be stuck with a lot of fruits/vegetables that you wont even care.  No variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money is only a wall to grind your upgrades, and even if you do well, like I mentioned in farming or cooking, you can only gain so much.  So it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.  Your progress doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Items are needed to improve one NPC house.  Items are gated by different vendors. I already bought all at the Normal Shop, Decor shop, and they don&amp;#39;t even sell anything anymore. Even after you max upgraded the shops to sell ALL items, it will only still sell a few.  Now those shops doesn&amp;#39;t sell anything anymore, I am just waiting for the Auction house every Saturday and Sunday.  You are time-gated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grind.  Grind levels so you can farm this, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter anyway, you wont be able to sell much.  There is no point or even the dangling carrot of gameplay that hey, do this to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like when I talked to the NPC who has the boat, and said, you can only use my boat if you give 10k wood.  Then the dialog was closed.  I thought it was real and that the gameplay will allow me to harvest such number. But no, you have to talk to him and he will tell you, haha it is just a joke. I mean, why close the dialog and let the player roam free.  I did a full year without knowing I can already use the boat on Season 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;99 on a relationship, flirt, date, doesn&amp;#39;t matter, it wont go up or it wont do anything.  Is this an unfinished game?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I have money that I can&amp;#39;t spend, and almost max on my skills, that I thought will move forward the story.  But no, I still have one area that is locked.  I need to grind to sell some shit on the vendor so I can be visited by someone just to move the story.  I mean, that is really a bad design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I really regret getting this game. I really regret having this game to the point that I have to make this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a waste of purchase for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I love my Switch and gyro aiming is pretty incredible but...touchscreen aiming is really precise and the only thing that ever held it back from being a pretty much perfect mouse replacement, was that you had to lift your finger in order to hit the shoot button. The Switch, having a controller attached to it is exactly what would be needed.  \n\n\nI don't want to complain or anything, i'm not saying this as like a big point of critique towards developers, no i'm just curious. And i would definitely like such an option in games. I've tried it out and even i with my relatively small hands can reach the touchscreen with my thumb, while being able to press shoulder buttons on the right joycon. This is yet another way of aiming that no other console could give you, so i find it surprising that no games (or are there any you happen to know of?) include it as an option.  \n\n\nSo, how do you feel about this? Do you think this might be a great way of enhancing control in a FPS game? Do you see something that you find is an obvious counter point that i was missing? Let me know!",

I&amp;#39;ve used to play a lot on my phone before i bought my Switch, including FPS games. I love my Switch and gyro aiming is pretty incredible but...touchscreen aiming is really precise and the only thing that ever held it back from being a pretty much perfect mouse replacement, was that you had to lift your finger in order to hit the shoot button. The Switch, having a controller attached to it is exactly what would be needed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to complain or anything, i&amp;#39;m not saying this as like a big point of critique towards developers, no i&amp;#39;m just curious. And i would definitely like such an option in games. I&amp;#39;ve tried it out and even i with my relatively small hands can reach the touchscreen with my thumb, while being able to press shoulder buttons on the right joycon. This is yet another way of aiming that no other console could give you, so i find it surprising that no games (or are there any you happen to know of?) include it as an option.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, how do you feel about this? Do you think this might be a great way of enhancing control in a FPS game? Do you see something that you find is an obvious counter point that i was missing? Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

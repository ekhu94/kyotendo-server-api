        "selftext": "I’m not gonna make this a series, but I just want to make my passage on why *Mario Kart DS* is the best game in the series. \n\nLet’s start shall we...\n\n###I’ll start with snaking    \nSay what you want about it: call it too broken, or game-ruining, but ask anyone who has played Mario kart ds and has learned how to snake and they will tell you how fun and rewarding learning to successfully snake is. Its so fun and for what? \n\nThere’s also that extra bit: prolonged rocket boosting. This allows you to rid yourself of any off-road deficit but it’s really hard to pull off, especially with vehicles that aren’t egg1 and dry bomber. \n\nSo take two high skill techs and throw them in and you have a really nice playing experience. Of course you don’t HAVE to snake so the option’s there. \n\n###next, dat roster    \nThis is pretty ideal for a roster. ROB was such an eccentric addition that made this game all the more memorable. And the crazy part is that ROB hasn’t returned since and likely will never return in another Mario kart game. So there’s that unique factor along with having all the characters we would’ve expected and some we wanted (like dry bones). It is a little small, but I mean we couldn’t have possibly asked for more.\n\n###The karts    \naren’t the most memorable aspect of the game but they get the job done. If snaking wasn’t there to allow egg1, dry bomber, poltergust3000, and Rob bls to totally flatline everyone with no competition, this vehicle selection would be fantastic. Heck, even with snaking in mind, the vehicle selection is still pretty good. Egg 1 for the “all around” build, dry bomber for the more maneuverable build, Poltergust for the faster build and Rob BLS for the Pure speed and weight build. This is all good. \n\nThe stat balancing felt perfectly done in this addition. They had an excellent stat system and it was only perpetuated by each and every kart trio being unique in its own right. You have the Mario and Waluigi karts for all around, Daisy and Peach for your nasty good drift stats. Toad and dry bones for the crazy off-road, dry bones and Yoshi for the nasty good acceleration, bowser and rob for the disgusting speed and weight, Wario and donkey Kong for the faster builds. There aren’t really any “terrible” karts here. They’re all serviceable in their own right. It’s a nice challenge every now and then to win races using the hurricane rather than the standard LG for example. \n\n###Lets move on the the racing...    \nThe racing felt glorious to me. Apart from snaking, the handling felt buttery smooth and there aren’t really any holes in the gameplay. You can even jump to turn easier at the expense of some risky air pockets. This makes playing karts with low handling very doable. Everything I just mentioned comes together to form a really nice gameplay experience. \n\nAlso, you can get high air and weird alignments when you “trick” off ramps which is something good to explore. I think the best track to try this out on is Waluigi pinball. It’s a really nice dynamic for what it is. \n\nThe karts’ hitboxes also aren’t weird and buggy like they were in wii, which is nice.\n\n###The tracks.    \nTell me what you will, but I stand by this track selection IMMENSELY. I mean sure there are some complete duds, like choco island 2 or Koopa beach 1, but seriously, this game has some of the best tracks in Mario kart. Delfino square, airship fortress, Waluigi pinball, Sky garden, Bowser’s Castle, Yoshi Circuit, these are all elite level tracks that can’t be tainted no matter how you put it. There are only a select few that I would consider complete flops and the every other track is serviceable to elite. \n\nAlso, while this is more subjective, 3 of my top 5 favorites are DS tracks... I don’t know what that says about me or the game, but yeah... there it is.\n\nThe battle courses are also... AMAZING. I’ll admit that tart top is terrible, but all the other ones are great, fun tracks with relatively good design to perfect design. It has the 2 best battle courses... nuff said, AND the selection is well rounded. 2 open, 2 moderately open, and 2 complex. \n\n###Let’s get into the good stuff...    \nBattle mode...    \n...    \n...    \n...    \nneed I say more?    \nNo, but I’m going to anyway because HOOO bitch... what a game mode. \n\nThe balloon battle is immense fun even on singleplayer. The gameplay on this one is literally so well designed.  If you don’t know how it works allow me to explain. You start each match with 5 balloons. 4 in your inventory and 1 that’s inflated. If you get hit while you have 1 balloon inflated, you lose. It’s up to you to inflate your own balloons with your mic, or the select button. The mic is faster but the select button is more consistent. You might think “just blow them all up what’s the big deal” we’ll that’s where you’re wrong my friend. The less balloons you have inflated, the better your item pulls will be... ISNT.THAT.CRAZY? You could blow up all your balloons but you will be stranded with nothing but banana peels and green shells, which is good I guess if you’re going for a “trapper” playstyle. My playstyle is always to grab an item box with 1 balloon until I get triple reds and then start inflating my balloons. Usually it’s best to have 2 out, but even with 2 you’re not safe from elimination. If someone with a red shell and a mushroom catches you, you’re dead unless you defend properly. Mushrooms know no i frames. \n\nLike just read all this... there are many different play styles you can adopt for this game mode meanwhile in other game’s battle mode it’s always, clutch the victory or dominate. You can’t really decide the pace or the item playstyle of your match. This game has the best balloon battle and it isn’t close...\n\nNow onto shine runners. A lot of people think this is just a bootleg shine thief but it’s not the same at all. It’s more like a “coin runners premium” where it’s better in every way. Allow me to explain the rules. You run around collecting shines, you can hit people to knock out one of their shines. Every now and then, players will be eliminated. If you have the least amount of shines or you tie with another player for the least amount of shines, you get eliminated on that increment. It’s not as fun as the balloon battle, but it serves as a really nice fast-paced battle mode in contrast to the controlled environment of the balloon battle. I wish the CPU’s were better at this game mode so I could enjoy it more. \n\nThese two game modes are elite and these two game mode alone could back my argument up all the way. \n\n###Missions    \nThis game mode is the one you play when you want a challenge. It’s seriously makes me want to tear my hair out. It’s so frustrating and that’s what makes it so good. I still haven’t even beaten wiggler that’s how challenging it is. The fact that for the most part, DS is relatively not challenging but then they round it off with missions is monsterous. The first 4 worlds are easy to 3 star, but then after that?? Good luck. Good luck indeed. Missions are so memorable and yet they didn’t even come back for another Mario kart game. This is the game mode that makes Mario kart ds so unique. The best singleplayer Mario kart was made by this game mode. Remember that. \n\n###Multiplayer.    \nI am fully aware that this game requires ALOT to play multiplayer. For download play you need multiple ds’s, for online you need an unsecured connection, it’s a mess, but still fun nevertheless. It’s no party game, but that’s okay. But just imagine an 8 player Mario kart DS room. I fantasize about that all the time. Imagine how fun playing balloon battle with 8 friends is. I’m jumping in my chair just thinking about it. If only I had friends 😢...\n\n###All in all...    \nThis game is in my eyes the most well rounded. Great racing and great battle mode, whereas in every other game it felt like we got one or the other.",

They had an excellent stat system and it was only perpetuated by each and every kart trio being unique in its own right. You have the Mario and Waluigi karts for all around, Daisy and Peach for your nasty good drift stats. Toad and dry bones for the crazy off-road, dry bones and Yoshi for the nasty good acceleration, bowser and rob for the disgusting speed and weight, Wario and donkey Kong for the faster builds. There aren’t really any “terrible” karts here. They’re all serviceable in their own right. It’s a nice challenge every now and then to win races using the hurricane rather than the standard LG for example. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Lets move on the the racing...&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The racing felt glorious to me. Apart from snaking, the handling felt buttery smooth and there aren’t really any holes in the gameplay. You can even jump to turn easier at the expense of some risky air pockets. This makes playing karts with low handling very doable. Everything I just mentioned comes together to form a really nice gameplay experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, you can get high air and weird alignments when you “trick” off ramps which is something good to explore. I think the best track to try this out on is Waluigi pinball. It’s a really nice dynamic for what it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The karts’ hitboxes also aren’t weird and buggy like they were in wii, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The tracks.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell me what you will, but I stand by this track selection IMMENSELY. I mean sure there are some complete duds, like choco island 2 or Koopa beach 1, but seriously, this game has some of the best tracks in Mario kart. Delfino square, airship fortress, Waluigi pinball, Sky garden, Bowser’s Castle, Yoshi Circuit, these are all elite level tracks that can’t be tainted no matter how you put it. There are only a select few that I would consider complete flops and the every other track is serviceable to elite. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, while this is more subjective, 3 of my top 5 favorites are DS tracks... I don’t know what that says about me or the game, but yeah... there it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The battle courses are also... AMAZING. I’ll admit that tart top is terrible, but all the other ones are great, fun tracks with relatively good design to perfect design. It has the 2 best battle courses... nuff said, AND the selection is well rounded. 2 open, 2 moderately open, and 2 complex. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Let’s get into the good stuff...&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Battle mode...&lt;br/&gt;\n...&lt;br/&gt;\n...&lt;br/&gt;\n...&lt;br/&gt;\nneed I say more?&lt;br/&gt;\nNo, but I’m going to anyway because HOOO bitch... what a game mode. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The balloon battle is immense fun even on singleplayer. The gameplay on this one is literally so well designed.  If you don’t know how it works allow me to explain. You start each match with 5 balloons. 4 in your inventory and 1 that’s inflated. If you get hit while you have 1 balloon inflated, you lose. It’s up to you to inflate your own balloons with your mic, or the select button. The mic is faster but the select button is more consistent. You might think “just blow them all up what’s the big deal” we’ll that’s where you’re wrong my friend. The less balloons you have inflated, the better your item pulls will be... ISNT.THAT.CRAZY? You could blow up all your balloons but you will be stranded with nothing but banana peels and green shells, which is good I guess if you’re going for a “trapper” playstyle. My playstyle is always to grab an item box with 1 balloon until I get triple reds and then start inflating my balloons. Usually it’s best to have 2 out, but even with 2 you’re not safe from elimination. If someone with a red shell and a mushroom catches you, you’re dead unless you defend properly. Mushrooms know no i frames. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like just read all this... there are many different play styles you can adopt for this game mode meanwhile in other game’s battle mode it’s always, clutch the victory or dominate. You can’t really decide the pace or the item playstyle of your match. This game has the best balloon battle and it isn’t close...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now onto shine runners. A lot of people think this is just a bootleg shine thief but it’s not the same at all. It’s more like a “coin runners premium” where it’s better in every way. Allow me to explain the rules. You run around collecting shines, you can hit people to knock out one of their shines. Every now and then, players will be eliminated. If you have the least amount of shines or you tie with another player for the least amount of shines, you get eliminated on that increment. It’s not as fun as the balloon battle, but it serves as a really nice fast-paced battle mode in contrast to the controlled environment of the balloon battle. I wish the CPU’s were better at this game mode so I could enjoy it more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two game modes are elite and these two game mode alone could back my argument up all the way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Missions&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game mode is the one you play when you want a challenge. It’s seriously makes me want to tear my hair out. It’s so frustrating and that’s what makes it so good. I still haven’t even beaten wiggler that’s how challenging it is. The fact that for the most part, DS is relatively not challenging but then they round it off with missions is monsterous. The first 4 worlds are easy to 3 star, but then after that?? Good luck. Good luck indeed. Missions are so memorable and yet they didn’t even come back for another Mario kart game. This is the game mode that makes Mario kart ds so unique. The best singleplayer Mario kart was made by this game mode. Remember that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Multiplayer.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am fully aware that this game requires ALOT to play multiplayer. For download play you need multiple ds’s, for online you need an unsecured connection, it’s a mess, but still fun nevertheless. It’s no party game, but that’s okay. But just imagine an 8 player Mario kart DS room. I fantasize about that all the time. Imagine how fun playing balloon battle with 8 friends is. I’m jumping in my chair just thinking about it. If only I had friends 😢...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;All in all...&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game is in my eyes the most well rounded. Great racing and great battle mode, whereas in every other game it felt like we got one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
